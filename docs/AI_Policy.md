## üéØ Purpose
Meeting Policy Checker is a micro-agent designed to support the verification of meeting agendas and transcripts against predefined organizational policies.  
The system produces structured reports (JSON/Markdown) with compliance scores, findings, and suggested fixes.  
It does not take autonomous decisions: it requires textual input and assumes human supervision for interpretation and use of results.

## üå± Guiding Principles

- **Transparency**  
  Compliance logic is encoded in editable Markdown files (`meeting_policy_checker_logic.md`).  
  Outputs are validated against a strict JSON schema, but no machine-readable logs are stored beyond runtime.  
  Users are clearly informed about scope and limitations.  

- **Mandatory Human Oversight**  
  Meeting Policy Checker does not replace compliance officers or meeting managers.  
  Reports must be interpreted and validated by authorized staff. No organizational decision is applied automatically.  

- **Data Minimization**  
  Meeting texts are processed transiently.  
  The system does not retain logs or personal data. In CI/CD test mode, no external model calls are performed.  

- **Content Neutrality**  
  Outputs are limited to organizational compliance.  
  The system never generates discriminatory, sensitive, or legally binding content. It is not suitable for medical, legal, or other critical domains.  

- **Proportionate Responsibility**  
  The organization guarantees technical functioning within declared limits.  
  Misuse or misinterpretation of reports falls outside its responsibility.  

- **Continuous Improvement**  
  The system is periodically reviewed. Updates to policy logic or features are documented transparently.
